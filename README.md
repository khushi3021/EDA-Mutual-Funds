# EDA-Mutual-Funds

This repository contains the code and data for an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focused on mutual funds in India. The purpose of this project is to gain insights into the performance, risk, and trends of various mutual funds available in the Indian market.

The project aims to perform exploratory data analysis on a dataset comprising mutual fund information such as fund names, categories, asset allocation, returns, expense ratios, etc. By leveraging data visualization and statistical techniques, we seek to answer key questions related to mutual funds' performance and risk, identify the best-performing funds in different categories, and uncover trends and patterns in the mutual fund industry in India.

The data used for this project is obtained from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ravibarnawal/mutual-funds-india-detailed , which provides comprehensive mutual fund data for the Indian market. The dataset includes historical performance metrics, expense ratios, fund manager details, and other relevant attributes of various mutual funds.

The analysis is divided into several sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of mutual funds in India. Here are some of the key analyses performed:

Overview of the mutual fund industry in India
Categorization of mutual funds and their asset allocation
Performance comparison of top-performing funds
Risk analysis and volatility assessment
Expense ratio trends and impact on returns
